				<p style="margin-top:40px;">Monocle is a survey creation platform, similar to Survey Monkey. Users can create surveys based off of question templates, share to the world via the internet and social media platforms, and then see submission results via a dashboard. DatStat’s current survey and data collection platform is several years old, so Monocle is the start of the companies next generation of software. As of now, Monocle only covers basic survey creation capabilities, and there are plans to scale it with features such as question logic and a variable library.</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom:80px;">When I first started working for DatStat, Monocle was in the middle of the wireframing stage for it’s core sections. I began working out the rest of the wireframes, and focusing on creating themes for the surveys. The surveys were meant to render beautifully on all device sizes, so I had to create 2-3 mockups of each question type for how they would behave. This was easy for some question types such as multiple choice and comment boxes, but much trickier for things like tables and questions with a lot of imagery. </p>

		<p>When the themes were done and engineering was focusing on implementing them, I turned to the look and feel of the web app. This involved discussion with the CTO, who had the initial vision for the product. We decided on flat ui, using a teal blue as the main brand color, with orange for call to action areas of the app. After the name Monocle was chosen for the product, I began the process of developing a logo. The intent was to design something that conveyed a monocle, and was simple enough to be used in a range of sizes (favicon, app icon, etc).</p>

		<p>As the developers worked I spent a lot of time QA-ing the functionality of the platform, and communicating to the developers when something design-wise wasn’t implemented to completion.</p>

		<p>The final piece for the v1 push for Monocle was a marketing website. The site structure contained two pages: An initial sign up page, and a product features page. The product features page contained several full screen sections, each one with information about a different feature. My role was as the graphic designer, a developer implemented the site.</p>
