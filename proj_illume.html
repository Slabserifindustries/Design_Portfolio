				<p style="margin-top:40px;">At the core of DatStat's data managment application ecosystem is a data collection app called Illume. The software enables users to create forms and surveys to collect data for their study. The previous versions of illume did not support responsive design and were visually dated. For this product release my focus was on designing responsive versions of all the question types and re-skinning the general look and feel of the default survey template.</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom:80px;">When I first started working for DatStat, Monocle was in the middle of the wireframing stage for itâ€™s core sections. I began working out the rest of the wireframes, and focusing on creating themes for the surveys. The surveys were meant to render beautifully on all device sizes, so I had to create 2-3 mockups of each question type for how they would behave. This was easy for some question types such as multiple choice and comment boxes, but much trickier for things like tables and questions with a lot of imagery. </p>

		<p>When the themes were done and engineering was focusing on implementing them, I turned to the look and feel of the web app. This involved discussion with the CTO, who had the initial vision for the product. We decided on flat ui, using a teal blue as the main brand color, with orange for call to action areas of the app. After the name Monocle was chosen for the product, I began the process of developing a logo. The intent was to design something that conveyed a monocle, and was simple enough to be used in a range of sizes (favicon, app icon, etc). The name Monocle was chosen because when taking a survey, there is a focused objective and the results let you get a detailed look at what you are researching.</p>
