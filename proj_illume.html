				<p style="margin-top:40px;">At the core of DatStat's data management application ecosystem is a data collection desktop application called Illume. The software enables users to create forms and surveys to collect data for their study. The previous versions of illume did not support responsive design and were visually dated. About a year ago, the web app <a href="http://slabserif.github.io/Design_Portfolio/proj_monocle.html"/>Monocle</a> was in development to replace Illume, but due to a shift in market goals the company decided to stop working on it and focus back on the current product. For this release my focus was on designing responsive versions of all the question types and re-skinning the general look and feel of the default survey template.</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom:80px;">DataStat recently rebranded itself, with a new standard font and color selection. Historically the companies apps have not had a sense of unified branding, so for this project I worked within the brand guidelines, and hope to do so for future products to create the sense of an app ecosystem.</p>

		<p>Much of the ui work involving responsive question types I had experience with before when working on <a href="http://slabserif.github.io/Design_Portfolio/proj_monocle.html"/>Monocle</a>, which sped up the process and helped avoid some mistakes from before. I think I really improved on how I organize my style guides as a result of this project. The approach I took utilized global styles much more frequently then previous projects I'd worked on, and provided constraints while I was designing the ui so the design is very consistent.</p>

		<p>Illume had never had it's own logo, but since we were rebranding Illume as Illume Next, I was tasked to create one for use mainly as a desktop icon. The logo was meant to convey the concept of surveys and the sense of something new and moving forward. The chosen logo involves a simple check-mark with an arrow coming off the end of it.</p>
