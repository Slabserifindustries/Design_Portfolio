				<p style="margin-top:40px;">DatStat as a company has had its roots in providing data collection software for academic research, but is positioning itself to move into the healthcare and clinical trials space. As part of a marketing campaign, I was asked to make a short video, conveying to potential customers how our products can help them in their industry. The video emphasizes improved efficiency and speed in data collection and analysis, affordable pricing, and do it yourself capabilities backed up with excellent customer service.</p>

					<p>The narrative follows a healthcare worker who is currently using a different vendor’s electronic data capture solution. She is frustrated with how long it takes to get assistance for things she could easily do herself. This is conveyed in the video using the metaphor of the experience one is likely to have at the DMV. You wait in a long line, the clerks are not always friendly, and it’s a task you want to put off as long as possible. We show DatStat in contrast as a positive experience. A quick example of a task a clinical trial worker may have to go through is presented, putting the user in control of their own software while saving time and money.</p>

					<p>As the sole motion designer, I was given a script from our marketing team and started with the storyboarding process. The script had several major changes, so the storyboards in the beginning were completely different from the end product. After the script was more finalized, we sat down in several meetings where I got feedback on the new storyboard, and made refinements.</p>

					<p>Once the storyboard was approved, I started making the visual assets while I waited on receiving the audio. I decided to go with a vector based style for the video for several reasons. Working in vectors gave me a lot of flexibility to go back and make changes well into the animation process. The style and simple imagery gives a light weight, friendly feeling.</p>

					<p>Once the audio was handed to me, I started animating the pieces I thought would be the most challenging or time consuming. We entered an iterative process where a few segments of the video ended up being changed, which was a smooth switch because I divided the animations into compositions based on each point the video hit on. Overall the process was a positive one, and I learned a lot to improve the speed and cleanliness of my animation approach. </p>
